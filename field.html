<p>
A flimflam flopped from a fillamaloo,<br>
Where the pollywog pinkled so pale,<br>
And the pipkin piped a petulant "pooh"<br>
To the garrulous gawp of the gale.<br>
"Oh, woe to the swap of the sweeping swipe<br>
That booms on the hobbling bay!"<br>
Snickered the snark to the snoozing snipe<br>
That lurked where the lamprey lay.<br>
</p>
<p>
The gluglug glinked in the glimmering gloam,<br>
Where the buzbuz bumbled his bee--<br>
When the flimflam flitted, all flecked with foam,<br>
From the sozzling and succulent sea.<br>
"Oh, swither the swipe, with its sweltering sweep!"<br>
She swore as she swayed in a swoon,<br>
And a doleful dank dumped over the deep,<br>
To the lay of the limpid loon!<br>
